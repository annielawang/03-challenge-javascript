## Description

  To build a random password generator using what I have learned so far, including data types, variables, operators, conditional statements, functions, methods. 
- What problem does it solve?  
  This password generator can generate a random password based on the criteria selected by users.
- What did you learn?  
  I have learned how to practice the theory and search the information I need on internet.
## Usage
Users can go to the website and find a password generator page. By clicking on the Generate Password button, the user will be prompted to enter a password length. If a valid password length is entered, the user will be prompted with password criteria one by one, including lowercase, uppercase, number and special characters. Based on the criteria selected, a random password that meets all the selected criteria will be displayed on the webpage.Users can access the link here: ()
